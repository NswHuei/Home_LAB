# Project: Wazuh SIEM Deployment on a Virtual Machine

## üéØ Project Objective

To establish a centralized Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platform for the Home Lab. This project aims to deploy, configure, and manage a Wazuh instance to provide real-time log analysis, intrusion detection, and security visibility across all lab components.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The SIEM architecture is designed to be decoupled from the storage hardware for maximum flexibility. A dedicated Virtual Machine will host the Wazuh server, collecting logs from various agents deployed across the network.

*(A simple diagram will be added here later)*
`[Log Source 1: Main PC]` --> `[Wazuh Agent]` --> `[Wazuh Server @ VM]` <-- `[Analyst UI]`
`[Log Source 2: NAS]` --> `[Wazuh Agent]` --> `           ^`

## üöÄ Deployment Plan (MVP)

The initial goal is to create a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of the SIEM platform.

### Phase 1: Server Setup (‚úÖ Completed / ‚è≥ In Progress)
- [ ] **1. VM Provisioning:** Set up a dedicated VM using VMware Workstation with Ubuntu Server 22.04.
- [ ] **2. Wazuh Installation:** Install the Wazuh indexer, Wazuh manager, and Wazuh dashboard components.
- [ ] **3. Network Configuration:** Configure firewall rules to allow log ingestion (ports 1514, 514) and access to the dashboard (port 443).

### Phase 2: First Agent Deployment
- [ ] **1. Agent Installation:** Deploy the first Wazuh agent on a Windows 11 machine.
- [ ] **2. Log Verification:** Confirm that logs from the Windows agent are successfully received and displayed in the Wazuh dashboard.
- [ ] **3. Basic Analysis:** Review default alerts and dashboards generated by the agent's activity.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
